 *
 * - Tokens that are not transferable from one address to another, but may be
 * delegated to a validator {getAndUpdateLockedAmount}. This lock enforces
 * Proof-of-Use requirements. See {TokenLaunchLocker}; and,
 *
 * - Tokens that are neither transferable nor delegatable
 * {getAndUpdateForbiddenForDelegationAmount}. This lock enforces slashing.
